## Usage Guidelines

### Issue Priority Assignment
1. **Platinum Priority**: Top 16 users (Score 65+) - Immediate attention
2. **Gold Priority**: VIP staff members (Score 50-64) - High priority
3. **High-VIP**: Other VIP donors - Elevated priority
4. **Staff Role**: Any staff member regardless of donor status
5. **Donor Tiers**: Based on financial contribution level

### Label Combinations
- Use multiple labels for comprehensive player identification
- Example: `priority: platinum` + `donor: vip` + `role: staff` + `faction: osf`
- Combine faction labels for multi-faction players

### Statistics Reference
- **Total Users**: 731 valid profiles
- **Top Tier**: 16 users (Scores 65-83)
- **VIP Donors**: 195 users total
- **Combined Status**: 147 users (donor + whitelist)
- **Staff Members**: Variable count across tiers

## Implementation Notes

1. Labels should be created in GitHub repository settings
2. Use exact color codes provided for consistency
3. Apply labels based on Steam64 ID lookup in profiles
4. Update labels when player status changes
5. Consider automated labeling based on Steam ID recognition

## Color Scheme Logic
- **Purple/Violet**: Top tier and authority roles
- **Gold/Amber**: High-value contributors
- **Green/Emerald**: VIP status and faction roles
- **Blue/Indigo**: Mixed status categories
- **Red**: Staff and critical roles
- **Gradient by tier**: Donor levels use warm-to-cool progression
